# Tic Tac Toe kata

## Rules

- The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares
- Players alternate placing X’s and O’s in empty squares
- X always plays first
- Players cannot play on a played square
- A Player wins when it has three squares in a row
  - Horizontally
  - Vertically
  - Diagonally
- If all nine squares are filled and neither player has won, the game is a draw

## Follow TDD rules strictly

1. ✅ Write production code only to pass a failing unit test
2. ✅ Write only enough of a unit test to make it fail
3. ✅ Write only enough production code to make the failing test pass

## First run

Implement Tic Tac Toe as best as you can using TDD.

## Second run

Implement Tic Tac Toe strictly applying object calisthenics rules.

## Object calisthenics

### In order of importance (defined by Pedro)

- Wrap all primitives and strings
  - Wrap primitives in a type, specially if it has behaviour or it’s an important domain concept
- First class collections
  - Wrap collections in a type, specially if it has behaviour or it’s an important domain concept
- One dot per line
  - Do not write dog.Body.Tail.Wag() write dog.ExpressHappiness() - Law of Demeter
- No getters/setters/properties, no access to private data, none! - TELL DON’T ASK!
- No classes with more than two instance variables
- Only one level of indentation per method
- Don't use the ELSE keyword
- Don't abbreviate names
- Keep all entities small
  - 10 files per package/namespace
  - 50 lines per class
  - 5 lines per method
  - 2-3? arguments per method

## Great habits

### Considerations when writing a new test

- Tests should test one thing only.
- Create more specific tests to drive a more generic solution (triangulate).
- Give your tests meaningful names (behavior/goal-oriented) that reflect your business domain.
- See the test fail for the right reason.
- Ensure you have meaningful feedback from failing tests.
- Keep your tests and production code separate.
- Organize your unit tests to reflect your production code (similar project structure).
- Organize your test in arrange, act and assert blocks.
- Write the, or at least focus on the, assertion first and work backward.
- Write fast, isolated, repeatable and self-validating tests.

### Considerations when making a failing test pass

- Write the simplest code to pass the test.
- Write any code that makes you get to the refactor phase quicker.
- Use Transformation Priority Premise.
- Consider using object calisthenics to drive design decisions.

### Considerations after the test passes

- Use the Rule of Three to tackle duplication.
- Refactor design constantly.
- Apply object calisthenics to improve your design.
